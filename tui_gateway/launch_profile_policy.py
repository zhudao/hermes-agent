"""Launch-profile policy for a process that hosts several profile homes (``hermes serve`` /
``hermes dashboard`` pooling, ``?profile=``, hosted rooms; the multiplexed gateway's own worker).

Two facts anchor this module:

* ``agent.secret_scope.get_secret`` fails closed ONLY while ``set_multiplex_active(True)`` holds.
  A ``serve`` backend that hosts a second profile home never flipped it, so every unscoped read
  for a secondary profile silently returned the LAUNCH profile's ``os.environ`` value. The flip
  happens here, at the moment the process first learns it hosts another profile home.
* Once multiplexing is active the launch profile is a profile too: its turns/RPCs must run under
  their own scope instead of ambient ``os.environ`` (a secondary context may have poisoned it,
  #107422). A scope rebuilt from ``<launch home>/.env`` + ``config.yaml`` alone would drop the
  launch process's legitimate env-only policy — ``TERMINAL_ENV=ssh`` or a provider key injected
  by systemd / ``op run`` has no file to rebuild it from. The process env is trusted exactly
  once: frozen at activation, before any secondary code has run, never re-read afterwards.
