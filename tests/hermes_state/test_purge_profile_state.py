"""Regression tests for profile-keyed state purge on `hermes profile delete`.

`delete_profile` removes the profile directory and the multiplexer tears its runtime down, but the
profile name is also baked into session keys (``agent:<name>:*``), ``gateway_heartbeats.profile``,
``delivery_obligations`` and the ``gateway_routing`` index. Left stale, an inbound event on a chat
keyed to the deleted name resolves to a profile that no longer exists and floods errors.log — the
delete-side sibling of the rename rekey in #111926.
