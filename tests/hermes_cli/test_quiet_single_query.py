"""``hermes chat -Q`` as a dispatcher's re-run of a failed bot delivery (#111721).

A failed delivery turn persists its user row before the provider call; the policy-gated re-run
replays the same session and payload in a fresh process. Told so via HERMES_RESUME_UNANSWERED_TURN,
the re-run resumes that row instead of appending a second copy of the DM.
