/**
 * The welcome chat — the profile guided onboarding runs in.
 *
 * It is not an anonymous session: it belongs to a persistent `hermes-setup`
 * profile, so the conversation survives onboarding and can be found again. An
 * ordinary profile with an ordinary visible chat — there is no bot surface
 * here, and nothing in this flow mints one.
 *
 * `setup` is the INTERNAL name throughout this module (the profile key, the
 * atoms, the hidden `[setup]` notes). It is never what the user reads: to
 * them the voice is just Hermes, and the chat is titled `Welcome to Hermes`.
 *
 * When the first task is decided it is NOT built in this chat. The model emits
 * `::onboarding{step="handoff" task="…" brief="…"}` and the renderer opens a
 * NEW session on the user's default profile, seeded with the work-side
 * runbook, and starts the build there. The welcome chat hears how it went
 * through a hidden `[setup]` note.
 *
 * This module owns the pure pieces (names, souls, seed prompts, the handoff
 * request atom). The side effects — profiles.create, session.create, the chat
 * switch — live in the wiring's handoff effect so they run with real
 * gateway/session hooks.
